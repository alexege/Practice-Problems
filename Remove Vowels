#Define a function called anti_vowel that takes one string, text, as input and returns the text with all of the vowels removed.

#For example: anti_vowel("Hey You!") should return "Hy Y!". Don't count Y as a vowel. Make sure to remove lowercase and uppercase vowels.

def anti_vowel(text):
    new_word = ""
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    for char in text:
          if char not in vowels:
            new_word += char
    return new_word
print anti_vowel("Does this sentence contain vowels?")
